Each folder is a project and contains some jupyter notebook files (.ipynb) as well as html files genereted from these.
Necessary libraries can be installed using the 'Requirements.txt' file, but it is recommended to use anaconda.
To lunch a jupyter notebook simply run the following command from a terminal with python/anaconda installed:
> jupyter notebook [name of the file.ipynb]
